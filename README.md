## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. Go to server/db/index.js and configure your mySQL connection login
3. $ npm start
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase the use of an authentication system with the use of sessions and cookies. Shortly is a URL shortener service similar to Bitly which will enable users to have their own private set of shortened URLs.
